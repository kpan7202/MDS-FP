# MDS-FP

This repo stores the source codes for final project of my Master's Degree study at The University of Sydney.
This project tries to build a recommendation model by applying various data science techniques to help a task requester in selecting the best worker out of the bidders on a crowdsourcing platform. The data are collected by crawling a crowdsourcing platform witmart.com.

This project also applies an algorithm called DeepWalk to learn latent representation of vertices in a network. The detail of the algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk
